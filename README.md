## About

NameplateAuras displays players' buffs/debuffs above their nameplates. It is inspired by PlateBuffs which isn't maintained now.

## Facts

*   NameplateAuras should work with any non default nameplates (ofc default nameplates are supported too)
*   You can select filter for spells (only your buffs/debuffs or all). More filters soon.
*   List of built-in spells is short, but you can add custom spells.
*   It should has a little impact on performance (I'll do my best)
